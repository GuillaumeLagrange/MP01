ATHENS Week at Mines ParisTech


Client for small chat server coded in C++
Did not have the time to really finish the project, the backbone is however present. I will definitely finish it when I have the time though, for perfectionism's sake.
This week was really interesting and I feel like I made a lot of progress in C++.
